               Site Seeker is a <b>free</b> software that makes you know the
               exact position of your web site on the most famous search
               engines. It helps you to analyze the{' '}
               <abbr title="Search Engine Results Pages">SERPs</abbr> easily and
               quickly. To use it is very simple!
            </p>
            <p>
               The only things you have to do are: to point out the word or the
               words to search for, to insert the name of your website, to
               choose which search engine you want to use and nothing more. The
               program will entirely do your researches in automatic way and,
               then, you won't never do those boring manual researches you have
               always done before. Besides, Site Seeker is standalone, which
               means that requires no installation. Unzip the .zip file and run
               it.
